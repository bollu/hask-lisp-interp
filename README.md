### Introduction ###

The aim is to have a lisp interpreter in haskell.

### Goals ###
* have nice, readable, useful error messages
* have lexical scoping, not dynamic scoping
* have macros in the language
* write neat, documented code
* have a test framework / CI

### Nice to-haves ###
* emit LLVM code for speed
* alternatively, generate custom bytecode with things like constant folding so it's fairly optimised

### Non goals ###
* be "industrial strength"
* be the most lightweight interpreter around
